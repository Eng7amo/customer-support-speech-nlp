End-to-end NLP and Speech Recognition project analyzing customer support calls using SpeechRecognition, spaCy, and sentiment analysis.
# Customer Support Analytics using Speech Recognition and NLP

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for enhancing customer support services using Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The objective is to:
- Convert customer support audio calls into text
- Analyze sentiment from call transcriptions
- Extract named entities to identify recurring issues or references
- Retrieve the most similar customer calls based on a text query

The project is derived from a practical DataCamp project and emphasizes real-world applicability using open-source tools.
